    "\r\n",
    "Mean: The average value of a dataset. For example, calculating the mean of test scores to understand the average performance of studnts.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Median: The middle value of a dataset when it is sorted. It is less affected by extreme values and is useful for skewed distribtions.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Mode: The value that appears most frequently in a dataset. For example, identifying the mode of a set of exam scores to find the most commn score.\r\n",

    "\r",
    "Hypothesis Testing:\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Example: A pharmaceutical company testing a new drug may use hypothesis testing to determine if there is a significant difference in the effectiveness of the new drug compared to  placebo.\r\n",
    "Estimation:\r\n",

    "Q6. Why is it important to understand the level of measurement when analyzing data? Provide an\n",
    "example to illustrate your answer.\n",
    "Ans:-Understanding the level of measurement is crucial when analyzing data because it determines the types of statistical analyses and operations that can be applied to the data. Different levels of measurement have different properties, and using inappropriate statistical methods for a given level can lead to incorrect conclusions and misinterpretations of results. Here are a few reasons why understanding the level of measurement is important:\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Appropriate Statistical Technique:\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Different statistical techniques are suitable for different levels of measurement. For instance, parametric statistical tests (such as t-tests and ANOVA) assume certain properties of the data, like equal intervals between values and a normal distribution. Using these tests on nominal or ordinal data can lead to inaccurate results.\r\n",
    "Meaningful Interpretatons:\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "The level of measurement determines the meaningfulness of mathematical operations and comparisons. Ratios and differences between values have specific interpretations at the interval and ratio levels but lack such meaning at the nominal and ordinal levels.\r\n",
    "Understanding Relatinships:\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "The type of relationships that can be explored between variables depends on their levels of measurement. Correlation and regression analyses, for example, are appropriate for interval and ratio data but may not be meaningful for nominal or ordinal data.\r\n",
    "Appropriate Graphical Repreentations:\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Graphical representations, such as histograms, bar charts, or scatter plots, should be selected based on the level of measurement. Creating a histogram for nominal data, for instance, may not be meaningful, whereas a bar chart could be appropriate."
